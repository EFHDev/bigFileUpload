# File Share (Vencord)
This is a Vencord plugin that adds the `/fileshare` command. It allows you to upload files via the command to https://gofile.io/. After the files are uploaded, the gofile link containing the upload is pasted into your Discord chatbox where you ran the command. This is essentially a quick way to share your files. Very convenient if your files are too big to upload on Discord.

## DOWNLOAD INSTRUCTIONS
You can either __clone__ the repository OR __manually install__ it by downloading it as a zip file.<br/>
> [!WARNING]
> Make sure you have the Vencord [developer build](https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/) installed.<br/>

### CLONE INSTALLATION
The cloning installation guide can be found [here](https://discord.com/channels/1015060230222131221/1257038407503446176/1257038407503446176) or via [the official Vencord Docs](https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/custom-plugins/).

### MANUAL INSTALLATION
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Inside the `Vencord` folder should be a folder called `src`. If you haven't already, create a folder called `userplugins` inside the `src` folder.
1. Click the green `<> Code` button at the top right of the repository and select `Download ZIP`
2. Unzip the downloaded ZIP file into the `userplugins` folder.
3. Ensure it's structured as `src/userplugins/fileShare` or `src/userplugins/fileShare-main`
5. Run `pnpm build` in the terminal (command prompt/CMD) and the plugin should be added.

### Credits
This is a completed and fixed version of [samu.lol](https://github.com/144reasons)'s test plugin.
